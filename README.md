# Maker Studio Mods Registry

This repository is the curated index for the Maker Studio mod marketplace. The editor fetches `index.json` from this repo to populate the in-app Marketplace.

Looking for the editor itself? Download it and follow the installation guide in the main
[**Toskan4134/maker-studio**](https://github.com/Toskan4134/maker-studio#maker-studio) repo.

## How install is secured

The registry pins each mod to an exact `version` (semver tag) and the SHA-256 of its release zip. The editor:

1. Reads `index.json`.
2. Fetches the release at `/repos/{repo}/releases/tags/v{version}` — never `/releases/latest`.
3. Downloads the asset whose name matches `assetName`.
4. Hashes the bytes locally and refuses to install on any mismatch with the `sha256` field.

That means every new release a mod author publishes goes through a registry PR before it reaches users. The PR is the security boundary, not GitHub release auth.

## For users

Open Maker Studio → **Mods** menu → **Mod Manager** → **Marketplace** tab. The editor reads this `index.json` directly — no separate install step is needed. Don't have the editor yet? Get it from the [main repo](https://github.com/Toskan4134/maker-studio#maker-studio) (download buttons + [installation guide](https://github.com/Toskan4134/maker-studio/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#installation)).

## For mod authors

Want your mod listed here? Start with:

- **[docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md)** — **first-timers start here:** hands-on walkthrough (create → write → test → release → submit, ~25 min), then the full reference (release format, automation, registry PR, updates, submission rules, rejection reasons).
- **[docs/](docs/)** — Mod API reference, events list, getting-started, changelog, and `mod-api.d.ts` for IDE autocomplete.
- **[examples/](examples/)** — every bundled example mod with annotated walkthroughs. Best way to learn the API in context.
- **[`templates/publish.yml`](templates/publish.yml)** — drop-in GitHub Actions workflow that builds the zip, computes the SHA-256, attaches both to a GitHub Release, and prints the exact registry-PR diff.

In short:

1. Create a mod folder — copy one from [`examples/`](examples/) or hand-write `manifest.json` + `index.js` + `README.md` (the [walkthrough in Publishing](docs/publishing.md) walks through it).
2. Edit `index.js`, test locally.
3. Push to a **public** GitHub repo, tag `vX.Y.Z`. The template Action attaches `<modId>-<version>.zip` to a Release and prints the SHA-256.
4. Open a PR here adding your entry to `index.json` with `version`, `assetName`, and `sha256`. CI validates schema + checks release assets exist before merge.

## Registry schema

Canonical JSON Schema lives at [`schema/index.schema.json`](schema/index.schema.json) and is referenced from `index.json` via `$schema` — IDE autocomplete + validation work out of the box.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "id": "com.author.modname",
  "name": "My Mod",
  "authors": [{ "name": "Author Name", "url": "https://your-site" }],
  "repo": "owner/repo-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "assetName": "com.author.modname-1.0.0.zip",
  "sha256": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "description": "One sentence pitch.",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "icon": "https://...",
  "homepage": "https://...",
  "minStudioVersion": "2.0.0",
  "apiVersion": "1.0.1"
}
```

`version`, `assetName`, `sha256` are mandatory — the editor refuses to install without them. Editor caches the index for 1 hour. New entries go live within an hour of merge. CI ([`.github/workflows/validate-pr.yml`](.github/workflows/validate-pr.yml)) blocks PRs that fail schema validation, contain duplicate ids, or reference a release whose pinned asset doesn't exist.
