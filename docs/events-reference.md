# Events Reference

All event names and payload shapes. Listen via `ctx.bus.on(name, fn)`. Emit
via `ctx.bus.emit(name, payload)` (rarely needed — most mods only listen).

The TypeScript source of truth is the `EventMap` interface in
[`mod-api.d.ts`](./mod-api.d.ts).

## When events fire

- **`map.loaded`** — after a map's tiles, layers, and shadow data have been
  loaded into memory and a tab opened. Safe time to query `ctx.map.info(...)`.
- **`map.unloaded`** — after a map tab is closed and removed from the editor.
  `ctx.editor.activeMapId()` returns `null` when the last map is closed.
- **`map.tile.changed`** — fires once for each single-tile edit. For brush
  strokes that write many tiles, `map.batch.changed` fires once with the
  total count.
- **`map.batch.changed`** — fires for every tile write batch (brush, fill,
  rectangle, paste, undo/redo). Use this when you want a coarse "the map
  changed" signal.
- **`save.before`** — fires before the editor writes the map's `.rxdata`
  file. **Cancellable.** Return `{ cancel: true, reason: "..." }` to abort.
  Listeners are awaited in registration order; the first cancel wins.
- **`save.after`** — fires after a successful write. A good place to
  generate companion artefacts (XML exports, manifests, etc.).
- **`tool.activated`** — fires when the user (or a mod) switches the
  active tool, including switches to mod-registered tools.
- **`mod.loaded` / `mod.unloaded`** — fires for any mod including
  yours. Useful when a mod depends on optional collaborators.
- **`panel.opened` / `panel.closed`** — fires when a mod panel is opened
  or closed in the dock.
- **`selection.changed`** — fires when the tile selection changes (set,
  clear, modify).
- **`layer.changed`** — fires when a layer is mutated. `change` is one of:
  `"visibility"`, `"opacity"`, `"added"`, `"removed"`, `"active"`.
- **`viewport.changed`** — fires when the map viewport pans or zooms.
- **`hover.changed`** — fires when the cursor moves to a different tile. `x`/`y` are `null` when the cursor leaves the map canvas.
- **`clipboard.changed`** — fires after any copy, cut, or clipboard clear. `tiles` is the count of copied tiles (absent when cleared).
- **`brush.changed`** — fires when the user changes any brush property (size, rotation, flip, opacity, hue, saturation, lighting).
- **`tileset.changed`** — fires when the palette tileset is switched (`"selected"`), a tileset property is edited (`"edited"`), or tilesets are reloaded from disk (`"reloaded"`).
- **`undo`** / **`redo`** — fire after a successful undo or redo. `label` is the undo entry description.
- **`save.failed`** — fires when a save operation throws an error. `error` is the error message string.
- **`event.changed`** — fires after any RMXP event mutation (create, delete, move, update).
- **`paste.before`** — fires before a paste operation is committed. **Cancellable** — return `{ cancel: true, reason: "..." }` to abort. `tileCount` is the number of tiles in the clipboard.
- **`stats.changed`** — fires periodically (~60s) with updated editor statistics snapshots. `global` contains lifetime stats, `project` contains current project stats (or `null` if no project open).
- **`keybind.changed`** — fires when a keybind is changed via the settings dialog or the `ctx.keybinds` API. `actionId` is the affected action, `oldKey` and `newKey` are the normalized combo strings (e.g. `"ctrl+s"`).
- **`locale.changed`** — fires when the active editor language changes (View → Language, `ctx.i18n.setLocale`, or a mod-provided locale registering/unregistering). `locale` is the new locale code (e.g. `"en"`, `"es"`, or a mod-registered code). `ctx.i18n.onChanged(cb)` is the convenience wrapper.
- **`game.launch`** — fires once per Run Game invocation (toolbar button, menu item, or the `app.runGame` shortcut), right after the game-root check passes — before dirty maps are saved and the game actually launches. Fires regardless of outcome (launched, already running, a Proton prefix prompt shown/cancelled on Linux, or a launch error), so it's a reliable "the user asked to run the game" signal rather than a "game started" one.
- **`keybind.triggered`** — fires when the global shortcut dispatcher resolves a keydown to a built-in `actionId` and is about to run its handler. This is the *only* reliable way for a mod to know "the keyboard was just used for X": the dispatcher calls `e.stopImmediatePropagation()` right after resolving, and it's mounted on `window` in the capture phase before any mod loads — so a mod's own `keydown` listener, on whatever target or phase, never sees the event for a shortcut that actually fired. Does **not** cover mod-registered shortcuts (`ctx.menu.registerMenuItem`'s `shortcut`, `ctx.ui.registerShortcut`) — those resolve on a separate path.

## Cancellable handlers

`save.before` and `paste.before` are the cancellable events. Listeners may return a
Promise — the editor awaits all of them with a 5-second per-handler timeout.
A handler that times out is treated as non-cancel and a warning is logged.

```js
ctx.bus.on("save.before", async (e) => {
  const ok = await checkSomething(e.mapId);
  if (!ok) return { cancel: true, reason: "validation failed" };
});
```

## Inter-mod events

Mods can emit and listen to the standard events freely. There is no
sandboxing in v1 — all mods share the same bus. Use the `commands` API
(via `ctx.commands.register/execute`) for direct request/response patterns
where the bus would be awkward.

## Custom event commands (not bus events)

Distinct from the editor event **bus** above, a mod can also register a custom
**RMXP event command** that map makers insert into event pages — see
[`events.registerCommand`](./api-reference.md). These are not emitted on the bus;
they are stored on the map and run in-game. Each registered command appears on
its own named tab in the command picker; set `page` to title that tab (commands
sharing a `page` collect under it) and `pageDescription` for its one-line strip.

Each mod command is saved as a standard RMXP Script command (code 355) whose
`parameters[0]` is the literal Ruby that the command's `script(params, ctx)`
returns (e.g. `pbCameraScrollTo(0, -4)`). This keeps the map's `.rxdata`
round-tripping unchanged, passes `validateEvent` (355 is a known code), and runs
in-game like any other event script — there is no runtime dispatcher or handler
to register. The `ctx` argument says which event, page and list position the
command is being written at, so the generated Ruby can depend on where the map
maker dropped it.

## Editing an event's commands (not bus events)

Also distinct from the bus: a mod can read and rewrite the command list of an
**existing** event page. `events.getFull()` returns every page with its `list`
of commands; assign a new `list` and call `events.update()` to write it back
(one undoable change):

```js
const ev = ctx.events.getFull(mapId, eventId);
ev.pages[0].list = [ctx.events.createCommand(101, ["Hello"])];
ctx.events.update(mapId, ev);
```

`update()` appends the RMXP code-0 page terminator if your list lacks one, and
leaves a page's commands untouched if you omit its `list`. Full rules — appending
to an existing list, `validateEvent`, and command indent — are in
[api-reference.md](./api-reference.md) (`events`).
